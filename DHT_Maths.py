Chapter 1: Sets

Important Points:
- A set is a well-defined collection of objects.
- A set which does not contain any element is called the            empty set or the null set or the void set.
-A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite otherwise, the set is called infinite.
-Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements and we write A = B. Otherwise, the sets are said to be unequal and we write A ≠ B.
-A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B. We denote it as A ⊂ B.
-The union of A and B is the set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements of B. The symbol ‘∪’ is used to denote the union.
Some Properties of the Operation of Union
(i) A ∪ B = B ∪ A (Commutative law)
(ii) (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C) (Associative law)
(iii) A ∪ φ = A (Law of identity element, φ is the identity of ∪)
(iv) A ∪ A = A (Idempotent law)
(v) U ∪ A = U (Law of U)
-The intersection of sets A and B is the set of all elements which are common to both A and B. The symbol ‘∩’ is used to denote the intersection.
-Some Properties of Operation of Intersection
(i) A ∩ B = B ∩ A (Commutative law).
(ii) (A ∩ B) ∩ C = A ∩ (B ∩ C) (Associative law).
(iii) Φ ∩ A = φ, U ∩ A = A (Law of φ and U).
(iv) A ∩ A = A (Idempotent law)
(v) A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) (Distributive law)
-The difference of the sets A and B in this order is the set
of elements which belong to A but not to B. Symbolically, we write A – B and read as
“A minus B”
-Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A.
-Some Properties of Complement Sets
 1. Complement laws: (i) A ∪ A′ = U (ii) A ∩ A′ = φ
2. De Morgan’s law: (i) (A ∪ B) ´ = A′ ∩ B′ (ii) (A ∩ B) ′ = A′ ∪ B′
3. Law of double complementation: (A′) ′ = A
4. Laws of empty set and universal set φ′ = U and U′ = φ
